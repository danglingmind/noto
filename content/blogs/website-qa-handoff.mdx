# Why handoffs break

Handoffs fail when requirements are implied rather than documented. Teams assume alignment and discover gaps late.

## QA handoff checklist

- Responsive states approved
- Content finalized
- Edge cases documented
- Accessibility checks recorded
- Performance risks identified

## Validate with annotated evidence

Before release, verify each critical screen against approved annotations and mark items as complete.

## Close with a release review

A short final review catches regressions and ensures stakeholders agree on launch quality.
