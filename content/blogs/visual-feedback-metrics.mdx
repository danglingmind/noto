# Measure process quality, not just output

If you only measure delivery dates, you miss where feedback friction happens.

## Core metrics

- Time to first feedback
- Time to resolution
- Reopen rate
- Approval lead time

## Why reopen rate matters

A high reopen rate usually means comments were not clear or implementation missed context.

## Start simple

Track these metrics weekly and review trends monthly. Small process tweaks can unlock significant speed improvements.
