# Why feedback loops fail

Most teams do not struggle with *collecting* feedback. They struggle with organizing it, assigning ownership, and closing the loop.

When comments are scattered across chat, email, and screenshots, context gets lost. That creates duplicate work and slows releases.

## A compact 5-step loop

- Capture feedback directly on the exact page section.
- Group comments by scope: copy, UX, visual, and technical.
- Assign one owner per comment thread.
- Resolve with proof of change (new revision or screenshot).
- Confirm closure with stakeholder sign-off.

## What to standardize

Use one review template across all projects. Keep these fields mandatory:

- Issue summary
- Expected outcome
- Priority
- Owner
- Due date

## Result

A repeatable process reduces back-and-forth and helps teams move from "feedback received" to "feedback resolved" with less friction.
