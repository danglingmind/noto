# The approval bottleneck

Approvals often stall because expectations are not set early. Teams ship drafts, clients request broad changes, and timelines slip.

## Define approval stages

- Stage 1: Directional review
- Stage 2: Content and UX validation
- Stage 3: Final QA and sign-off

Each stage should have a clear objective and decision owner.

## Use review windows

Set fixed windows for feedback. Late comments should move to the next iteration unless they are blockers.

## Keep visibility high

A shared status view helps everyone track what is open, in progress, and approved.
