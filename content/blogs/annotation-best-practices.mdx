# Precision beats volume

A long feedback thread is not always useful. A short, specific comment attached to the right area is usually better.

## Rules for high-quality annotations

- Anchor feedback to a single UI element.
- Describe the issue and the intended change.
- Avoid bundled comments that contain multiple asks.
- Add priority to help sequencing.

## Example format

Use this structure for consistency:

`Current state -> Problem -> Proposed change -> Priority`

## Team alignment

When every stakeholder uses the same format, developers can implement faster and designers can validate changes with less confusion.
