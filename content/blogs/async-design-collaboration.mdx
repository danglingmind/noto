# Async needs structure

Asynchronous review works best when teams know where to comment, what details to include, and who closes each thread.

## Build an async review contract

- One source of truth for feedback
- Standard annotation format
- Explicit owner for each issue
- Clear done criteria

## Reduce context switching

Avoid splitting review conversations across multiple channels. Keep discussion attached to the exact artifact.

## Preserve decisions

A searchable decision log helps future contributors understand why changes were made.
