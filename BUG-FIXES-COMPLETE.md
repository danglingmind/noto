## **All Errors Successfully Resolved**

I've fixed all the compilation and runtime errors that were preventing your annotation system from working. Here's what was addressed:

---

## 🔧 **JavaScript/TypeScript Syntax Errors Fixed**

### **Problem 1: Variable Reassignment Error**

cannot reassign to a variable declared with `const`
```

**Fix Applied:**

- Used destructuring with different variable names to avoid conflicts
- Fixed the scope collision issue in `WebAnchorResolver.resolveTextTarget()`

**Files Modified:**

## 📦 **Missing Dependencies Installed**

### **Problem 2: Missing `sonner` Package**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'sonner'
```

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
npm install sonner
```

**Purpose:** Toast notifications for user feedback in the annotation system.
